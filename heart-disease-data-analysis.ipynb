    "The correlation between diabetes and the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) over ten years reveals a significant likelihood of having CHD. Individuals with diabetes exhibit a higher rate of CHD, with 36.7% of diabetic patients experiencing CHD, compared to only 14.62% of non-diabetic individuals. This significant difference is supported by a T-test, yielding a statistic of 4.73 and a p-value of approximately 0.0000068. Being that our p-value is so low this indicates the difference between the populations is not due to random chance. The T-statistic emphasizes the strength in our argument that there is a correlation of diabetes and CHD. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for the development of CHD. These findings let us argue that diabetic individuals need to be more thorough with their health to prevent heart disease.\n"

    "The distribution between smokers and non-smokers is nearly balanced, with non-smokers slightly outnumbering smokers. This suggests that the dataset includes a diverse set of individuals regarding their smoking habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing smoking populations between males and females we can see that males are significantly more likely to smoke. We know this because our p-value is exrememly small (2.2043519152601072e-38) and the t-statistic direction (13.09 positive), this suggests males have the higher rates of smoking. There isn't enough data to make concise assumptions on why males smoke more than females. Other factor such as lifestyle choices, cultural influences, or socioeconomic conditions contribute to the reason why. We can only speculate on the potential reasons for this observed difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heavy Smokers: Our data set shows that our smoking population tend to be heavy smokers. Specifically, the group smoking \"21-30 cigs per day\" represents the largest percentage (38.53%) of the smoker population. Additionally, the \"30+ cigs per day\" group also constitutes a substantial proportion (19.26%). This indicates that a majority of the smoking population tends towards higher daily cigarette consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moderate and Light Smokers: The categories \"11-20 cigs per day\" and \"6-10 cigs per day\" together make up about 32.81% of the smoker population. This suggests that while there is a considerable portion of the population that smokes moderately, the trend leans more towards heavier smoking habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health Implications: The high percentages of smokers in the heavier smoking categories (\"21-30\" and \"30+\") are concerning from a public health perspective. Higher daily cigarette consumption is strongly associated with greater health risks, including increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The distribution suggests that a significant portion of the smoker population is at a higher risk for these health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would all make sense being that the average age for our population's of smoker's is 47.73 years. Meaning when it comes to our smoker population we are dealing with an older generation. It is common knowledge that other generations were told smoking din't cause health problems. \n",

    "Looking at the blood pressure we can see that the non-smokers tend to have a higher blood pressure on average then the smokers. While the dataset suggests that non-smokers have higher average blood pressure than smokers, this counterintuitive result calls for the fact that other lifestyle and health factors are affecting blood pressure.

    "\n",
    "Given that the r-value is low for all population of groups of smokers (all smokers, smokers at risk of CHD, smokers not at risk of CHD), and that the linear regression correlation lines are mostly flat, we can comfortably say that the number of Cigarette someone smokes does not directly correlate with your blood pressure whether is be your Systolic or Dystolic Blood Pressure. Given this we should try to find a correlation between age and blood pressure for both population of smokers and non-smokers.\n",

    "\n",
    "The provided scatter plot data includes correlation coefficients and linear regression equations for the relationship between age and blood pressure among smokers, further divided into two subgroups based on their risk of Ten-Year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Looking at the data we can see moderate positive correlation between age and systolic blood pressure among smokers, with small differences in the rate of blood pressure increase and baseline levels depending on CHD risk status. This would make sense because as you age the harder your heart has to work to push blood throughout your body. From our groups of smokers you can see a trend that their hearts may be working a little harder then those who do not smoke. Being that their slopes and r-values are greater than the non-smokers slopes and r-values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Age vs Total Cholesterol: \n",
    "\n",
    "Another hypothesis we wanted to test was if smoking over long periods of time does increase total cholesterol. Note there is 2 kinds of cholesterol, [(bad cholesterol) LDL cholesterol and (good cholesterol) HDL cholesterol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576744/#:~:text=The%20nicotine%20in%20tobacco%20causes,lipids%20in%20the%20arterial%20wall.). This data accounts for the combination of these cholesterol, total cholesterol. We can see from the scatter plots that total cholesterol does increase as you age. When it comes to smoker's though their cholesterol levels tend to increase at a slower rate as they age. This correlation is not as strong as non-smokers. Meaning that smoking could be decreasing their good cholesterol levels and their bad cholesterol levels increasing as they age. Neatly enough though the population of smokers who are at risk of CHD, their r-value is negative and their slope is slightly negative. This means that ageing does not affect your total cholesterol levels. This may imply other factors such as smoking or other lifestyle choices are having a very slight negative effect on their cholesterol levels. When is comes to non-smokers you can see that their cholestorol also go up with age and at a faster rate as well. This though may be because their good cholestorl levels are taking up a majority of their total cholesterol levels. This is not the case for the non-smokers who are at risk of CHD. Being that there slope is zero and their r-value is very though this implies that for them age is not a factor for their risk of CHD, other facters are probably play a more sigificant role in their risk for CHD.
